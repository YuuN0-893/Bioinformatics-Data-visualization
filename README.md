In this project I will be using Python to explore Genomic data extracted from sources.


download GRCH38 - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_000001405.40/


download .cram file for NA12878. Eaily available online since it is used for many genomic research projects.


Samtools has been used for Reading/writing/editing/indexing/viewing the SAM/BAM/CRAM formats.


Other miscellaneous python libraries have been used.
